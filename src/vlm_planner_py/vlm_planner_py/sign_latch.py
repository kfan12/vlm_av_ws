"""Distance-gated latch for VLM sign labels (ROS-free, unit-tested).

Problem: the Qwen label on /vlm/sign is frame-global and sticky, while the
geometric board latch is per-board. Fusing "latest label" with "current board
distance" fails two ways:

  * A read taken FAR away (unreliable - small board, past misreads) sticks
    around and gets armed once the board later comes within reach.
  * A read taken too CLOSE returns 'none' (the camera crops the board top) or,
    with a second sign in view, the NEXT board's symbol, and overwrites a
    perfectly good earlier read right when the arbitration needs it.

Fix: attribute every read to the board that was latched WHEN ITS FRAME WAS
CAPTURED (inference takes ~2 s - the board has moved closer by the time the
label arrives), and accept it only if that board sat inside a readable
distance band:

    dist > max_dist_m   -> reject (far reads are unreliable)
    dist < min_dist_m   -> reject (board crops out of frame; a confident label
                           here is likely the NEXT sign - the latched label is
                           FROZEN below the floor)
    in band             -> accept; the NEWEST accepted read wins, so the
                           recognition refines as the board grows on approach
    'none'/'unparsed'   -> NEVER erase: with the board still geometrically
                           latched ahead, "can't read it" is occlusion/crop,
                           not absence. Existence is the geometry's call;
                           meaning is the VLM's.

The caller records (frame_stamp, board_dist) every tick and bumps the board
identity when the latched board passes behind; a label whose capture frame
belongs to a previous board is rejected as stale.
